This study evaluates deep learning solutions for lung segmentation in X-rays, ranking existing methods and analyzing their performance under diverse image modifications. Out of 61 analyzed papers, only nine offered implementation or pre-trained models, enabling assessment of three prominent methods: Lung VAE, TransResUNet, and CE-Net.
